# Simple Login System
This is an example of a simple login system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system consists of an HTML page with fields to enter a username and password, along with a login button.
A JavaScript script is used to verify the credentials provided by the user and display a success or error message.

## Project Files
- **index.html:** This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the login page, including input fields for username and password, the login button, and the feedback message.
- **styles.css:** This file contains CSS styling rules for the HTML page, such as text formatting, element positioning, and button styling.
- **script.js:** This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for validating user credentials and displaying feedback messages.

## Features
- **User Login:** Users can enter their username and password in the corresponding fields and click the "Login" button to attempt login.
- **Credential Validation:** The JavaScript script validates the credentials provided by the user. If the username and password are correct, a success message is displayed.
Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

## How to Use
1. Download the project files to your computer.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter a username and password in the appropriate fields.
4. Click the "Login" button to attempt login.
5. You will see a message indicating whether the login was successful or not.

## Customization
You can customize this login system in various ways, including:
- Adding additional input fields, such as email.
- Implementing password recovery functionalities.
- Styling the login page according to your application's needs.
